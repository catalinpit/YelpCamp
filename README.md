# YelpCamp Application
This is the application I created while following the course called "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">The Web Developer Bootcamp</a>". 
<p>This application allows people to add campgrounds from all over the world and the price for each campground per night. It also allows people to leave comments on each campgrounds.
</p>
<p>It's based on NodeJS and Express. </p>

<p>The application can be seen live <a href="https://peaceful-inlet-19247.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>
