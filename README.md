# YelpCamp Application
This is the application I created while following the course called "The Web Developer Bootcamp". 
<p>This application allows people to add campgrounds from all over the world and the price for each campground per night. It also allows people to leave comments on each campgrounds.
</p>
<p>It's based on NodeJS and Express. </p>
